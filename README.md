# For road transportation
This is a project where you can input lane.in and output it as an svg vector diagram of the lane.

At present, it is not possible to continuously draw a line more than one lane, that is, only one direction of an intersection can be shown.
Later it may be added to the entire floor plan and provide a GUI.
